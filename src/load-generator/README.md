# Retail Store Sample App - Load Generator

This is a utility component to generate synthetic load on the sample application, which is useful for scenarios such as autoscaling, observability and resiliency testing. It primarily consists of a set of scenarios for [Artillery](https://github.com/artilleryio/artillery), as well as scripts to help run it.

## Usage

A convenience script is provided to make it easier to run the load generator.
