  <h2>AWS Containers Retail Sample</h2>
  </strong>
</div>

This is a sample application designed to illustrate various concepts related to containers on AWS. It presents a sample retail store application including a product catalog, shopping cart and checkout.

It provides:

- A distributed component architecture in various languages and frameworks
- Utilization of a variety of different persistence backends for different components like MariaDB (or MySQL), DynamoDB and Redis
- The ability to run in various container orchestration technologies like Docker Compose, Kubernetes etc.
- Pre-built container images for both x86-64 and ARM64 CPU architectures
- All components instrumented for Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry OTLP tracing
- Support for Istio on Kubernetes
- Load generator which exercises all of the infrastructure

**This project is intended for educational purposes only and not for production use**

## Application Architecture

The application has been deliberately over-engineered to generate multiple de-coupled components. These components generally have different infrastructure dependencies, and may support multiple "backends" (example: Carts service supports MongoDB or DynamoDB).

## Quickstart

The following sections provide quickstart instructions for various platforms.

### Docker

This deployment method will run the application as a single container on your local machine using `docker`.

Pre-requisites:

- Docker installed locally

Run the container:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8080 public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-ui:1.0.0
```

Open the frontend in a browser window:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

To stop the container in `docker` use Ctrl+C.

### Docker Compose

This deployment method will run the application on your local machine using `docker-compose`.

Pre-requisites:

- Docker installed locally

Download the latest Docker Compose file and use `docker compose` to run the application containers:

```
curl https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app/releases/download/latest/docker-compose.yaml
DB_PASSWORD='<some password>' docker compose --file docker-compose.yaml up
```

Open the frontend in a browser window:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

To stop the containers in `docker compose` use Ctrl+C. To delete all the containers and related resources run:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml down
```

### Kubernetes

This deployment method will run the application in an existing Kubernetes cluster.

Pre-requisites:

- Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` installed locally

Use `kubectl` to run the application:

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app/releases/download/latest/kubernetes.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=available deployments --all
```

Get the URL for the frontend load balancer like so:

```
kubectl get svc ui
```

To remove the application use `kubectl` again:

```
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app/releases/download/latest/kubernetes.yaml
```

### Terraform

The following options are available to deploy the application using Terraform:

| Name                                             | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Amazon EKS](./terraform/eks/default/)           | Deploys the application to Amazon EKS using other AWS services for dependencies, such as RDS, DynamoDB etc.     |
| [Amazon EKS (Minimal)](./terraform/eks/minimal/) | Deploys the application to Amazon EKS using in-cluster dependencies instead of RDS, DynamoDB etc.               |
| [Amazon ECS](./terraform/ecs/default/)           | Deploys the application to Amazon ECS using other AWS services for dependencies, such as RDS, DynamoDB etc.     |
| [AWS App Runner](./terraform/apprunner/)         | Deploys the application to AWS App Runner using other AWS services for dependencies, such as RDS, DynamoDB etc. |
