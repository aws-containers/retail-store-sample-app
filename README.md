  <strong>
  <h2>AWS Containers Retail Sample</h2>
  </strong>
</div>

This is a sample application designed to illustrate various concepts related to containers on AWS. It presents a sample retail store application including a product catalog, shopping cart and checkout.

It provides:

- A demo store-front application with themes, pages to show container and application topology information, generative AI chat bot and utility functions for experimentation and demos.
- An optional distributed component architecture using various languages and frameworks
- A variety of different persistence backends for the various components like MariaDB (or MySQL), DynamoDB and Redis
- The ability to run in different container orchestration technologies like Docker Compose, Kubernetes etc.
- Pre-built container images for both x86-64 and ARM64 CPU architectures
- All components instrumented for Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry OTLP tracing
- Structured JSON logging across all services (Log4j2 JsonTemplateLayout, Go slog, winston)
- Comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring with alarms, anomaly detection, and operational dashboard
- CloudWatch Application Signals for SLO tracking and Application Map topology visualization
- ECS deployment circuit breakers with automatic rollback
- Support for Istio on Kubernetes
- Load generator which exercises all of the infrastructure

See the [features documentation](./docs/features.md) for more information.

## Application Architecture

The application has been deliberately over-engineered to generate multiple de-coupled components. These components generally have different infrastructure dependencies, and may support multiple "backends" (example: Carts service supports MongoDB or DynamoDB).

## Quickstart

The following sections provide quickstart instructions for various platforms.

### Docker

This deployment method will run the application as a single container on your local machine using `docker`.

Pre-requisites:

- Docker installed locally

Run the container:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8080 public.ecr.aws/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-ui:1.0.0
```

Open the frontend in a browser window:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

To stop the container in `docker` use Ctrl+C.

### Docker Compose

This deployment method will run the application on your local machine using `docker-compose`.

Pre-requisites:

- Docker installed locally

Download the latest Docker Compose file and use `docker compose` to run the application containers:

```
wget https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yaml

DB_PASSWORD='<some password>' docker compose --file docker-compose.yaml up
```

Open the frontend in a browser window:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

To stop the containers in `docker compose` use Ctrl+C. To delete all the containers and related resources run:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml down
```

### Kubernetes

This deployment method will run the application in an existing Kubernetes cluster.

Pre-requisites:

- Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` installed locally

Use `kubectl` to run the application:

```
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app/releases/latest/download/kubernetes.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=available deployments --all
```

Get the URL for the frontend load balancer like so:

```
kubectl get svc ui
```

To remove the application use `kubectl` again:

```
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app/releases/latest/download/kubernetes.yaml
```

### Terraform

The following options are available to deploy the application using Terraform:

| Name                                             | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Amazon EKS](./terraform/eks/default/)           | Deploys the application to Amazon EKS using other AWS services for dependencies, such as RDS, DynamoDB etc.     |
| [Amazon EKS (Minimal)](./terraform/eks/minimal/) | Deploys the application to Amazon EKS using in-cluster dependencies instead of RDS, DynamoDB etc.               |
| [Amazon ECS](./terraform/ecs/default/)           | Deploys the application to Amazon ECS using other AWS services for dependencies, such as RDS, DynamoDB etc.     |
| [AWS App Runner](./terraform/apprunner/)         | Deploys the application to AWS App Runner using other AWS services for dependencies, such as RDS, DynamoDB etc. |

## Monitoring & Observability

The ECS deployment includes a comprehensive monitoring module (`terraform/lib/ecs/monitoring/`) that can be enabled with `monitoring_enabled = true`. It provides:

| Capability | Resources | Description |
|---|---|---|
| CloudWatch Alarms | ~40 alarms | ALB errors/latency, ECS CPU/memory/health per service, Aurora, DynamoDB, ElastiCache |
| Anomaly Detection | 12 detectors | ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND alarms for ALB and per-service ECS metrics |
| Log Metric Filters | 6 filters + 3 alarms | Error count, exceptions, payment failures, database errors, auth failures |
| Contributor Insights | 2 rules | Top error endpoints, top request sources |
| X-Ray Insights | Group + 3 sampling rules | 100% error sampling, 100% slow request sampling, 25% baseline |
| Application Signals | Discovery + 10 SLOs | Availability and latency SLOs per service with burn rate alerts |
| Log Anomaly Detection | 1 detector | ML-based pattern anomaly detection on application logs |
| Log Field Indexes | 1 policy | Indexed fields for faster Logs Insights queries |
| Operational Dashboard | 1 dashboard | Service health, traffic, ECS compute, data stores |
| Circuit Breaker | All 5 services | Automatic rollback on deployment failures |
| Log Retention | 90 days | Compliance-ready log retention |
| SNS Alerting | 2 topics | Critical and warning alert channels with email subscription |

### Structured JSON Logging

All services emit structured JSON logs for CloudWatch Logs Insights, Contributor Insights, and field index compatibility:

| Service | Framework | Logging Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| UI, Cart, Orders | Java/Spring Boot | Log4j2 with `JsonTemplateLayout` (`log4j2-spring.xml`) |
| Catalog | Go/Gin | `log/slog` with `slog.NewJSONHandler` + custom Gin middleware |
| Checkout | Node.js/NestJS | `winston` with JSON transport via `nest-winston` |

### Enabling Monitoring

Via Terraform variables:
```hcl
monitoring_enabled                = true
alert_email                       = "your-email@example.com"
deployment_circuit_breaker_enabled = true
application_signals_enabled       = true
```

Via the "Deploy to ECS Fargate" GitHub Actions workflow, select `monitoring_enabled: true` when triggering the workflow.
