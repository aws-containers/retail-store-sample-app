# AWS Containers Retail Sample

This is a sample application designed to illustrate various concepts related to containers on AWS. It presents a sample retail store application including a product catalog, shopping cart and checkout.

It provides:
- A distributed component architecture in various languages and frameworks
- Utilization of a variety of different persistence backends for different components like MySQL, DynamoDB and Redis
- The ability to run in various container orchestration technologies like Docker Compose, Kubernetes etc.
- Pre-built containers image for both x86-64 and ARM64 CPU architectures
- All components instrumented for Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry OTLP tracing
- Support for Istio on Kubernetes
- Load generator which exercises all of the infrastructure

**This project is intended for educational purposes only and not for production use.**

## Application Architecture

The application has been deliberately over-engineered to generate multiple de-coupled components. These components generally have different infrastructure dependencies, and may support multiple "backends" (example: Carts service supports MongoDB or DynamoDB).

## Quickstart

The following sections provide quickstart instructions for various platforms. All of these assume that you have cloned this repository locally and are using a CLI thats current directory is the root of the code repository.

### Kubernetes

This deployment method will run the application in an existing Kubernetes cluster.

Pre-requisites:
- Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` installed locally

Use `kubectl` to run the application:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app/main/dist/kubernetes/deploy.yaml
kubectl wait --for=condition=available deployments --all
```

Get the URL for the frontend load balancer like so:

```
kubectl get svc ui
```

To remove the application use `kubectl` again:

```
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app/main/dist/kubernetes/deploy.yaml
```

### Docker Compose

This deployment method will run the application on your local machine using `docker-compose`, and will build the containers as part of the deployment.

Pre-requisites:
- Docker installed locally

Change directory to the Docker Compose deploy directory:

```
cd dist/docker-compose
```

Use `docker compose` to run the application containers:

```
MYSQL_PASSWORD='<some password>' docker compose --file dist/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml up
```

Open the frontend in a browser window:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

To stop the containers in `docker compose` use Ctrl+C. To delete all the containers and related resources run:

```
docker compose -f dist/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml down
```
