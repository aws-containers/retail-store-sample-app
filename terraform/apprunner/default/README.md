# AWS Containers Retail Sample - App Runner Terraform

This Terraform module creates all the necessary infrastructure and deploys the retail sample application on [AWS App Runner](https://aws.amazon.com/apprunner/).

It provides:

- VPC with public and private subnets
- An App Runner service per application component
  - The UI service serves a public endpoint
  - Backend components serve private VPC endpoints
- All application dependencies such as RDS, DynamoDB table, Elasticache etc. accessed using App Runner VPC egress networking

NOTE: This will create resources in your AWS account which will incur costs. You are responsible for these costs, and should understand the resources being created before proceeding.

## Usage

Pre-requisites for this are:

- AWS, Terraform and kubectl installed locally
- AWS CLI configured and authenticated with account to deploy to

After cloning this repository run the following commands:

```shell
cd terraform/apprunner

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

The final command will prompt for confirmation that you wish to create the specified resources. After confirming the process will take at least 15 minutes to complete.

NOTE: Due to the complexity of the Terraform configuration there are intermitent failures. Please retry running `terraform apply` before raising an issue.

You can then retrieve the HTTP endpoint for the UI from Terraform outputs:

```shell
terraform output -raw application_url
```

Enter the URL in a web browser to access the application.

## Reference

This section documents the variables and outputs of the Terraform configuration.
